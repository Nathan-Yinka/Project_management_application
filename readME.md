Project Management Application Backend
This is a backend service for managing projects within organizations. It provides APIs for listing, creating, updating, and managing projects, users, and their permissions using Django and Django REST Framework.

Features
1. User Authentication and Authorization
User Registration and Login: Allows users to register for a new account or log in with existing credentials.
Token-Based Authentication: Uses token-based authentication (such as JSON Web Tokens) to secure endpoints and validate user sessions.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implements role-based access to ensure that users can only perform actions that their roles permit.
2. CRUD Operations for Projects
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): Users can perform standard CRUD operations on projects, provided they have the appropriate permissions.
Project Assignment: Projects can be assigned to specific users within the organization, with validation to ensure that only members of the organization can be assigned.
Project Status Updates: Users with the necessary permissions can update the status of a project to track progress, with predefined statuses such as "In Progress," "Completed," or "Pending."
3. Organization Management with Membership Roles
Create and Manage Organizations: Users can create new organizations and invite other users to join. Each organization serves as a container for projects and members.
Membership Roles: Two primary roles are supported: "Admin" and "Member."
Leave Organization: Users can choose to leave an organization, which removes their access to associated projects and tasks.
4. User Role-Based Access Control Using Django Guardian
Object-Level Permissions: Uses Django Guardian to implement object-level permissions, allowing fine-grained access control to specific projects and tasks.
Custom Permissions for Roles: Admins can be given permissions such as "add_project" or "update_project_status" for projects within their organization.
Dynamic Permission Checking: The application dynamically checks permissions based on the user's roles and membership, ensuring secure access to resources.
5. Custom Permissions for Adding, Viewing, and Updating Projects and Users
CanAddProjectPermission: Ensures only users with the "add_project" permission within an organization can create new projects.
CanUpdateProjectStatusPermission: Checks whether a user has the "update_project_status" permission before allowing a status change on a project.
CanAddUserPermission: Controls whether a user can add other users to an organization, ensuring they have the "add_user" permission.
6. Assignment of Projects to Members Within an Organization
User Assignment Validation: When assigning a project to a user, the system validates that the user is a member of the organization to prevent unauthorized access.
Project Ownership and Accountability: Projects can be linked to users who are responsible for managing them, promoting accountability.
7. Custom Validation for Data Integrity
Ensures Assigned Users Are Organization Members: Before assigning a user to a project, the application verifies that the user is indeed a member of the organization.
Project and Organization Data Integrity Checks: Prevents actions that could compromise data integrity, such as deleting a project linked to active tasks.
8. User Membership Management
Invite and Manage Members: Admin users can invite other users to join the organization. Invitations are validated to ensure proper membership before granting access.
Role Management: Admins can assign roles (Admin or Member) to users to control what actions they can perform within the organization.
Pending Memberships: Supports a "pending" membership state for users who are invited to an organization but haven't joined yet.
9. Commenting System for Projects
Add Comments to Projects: Users can add comments to projects for discussions or updates.
Permissions for Commenting: Users can only comment if they have the required permissions, which can be assigned based on organization roles.
10. API Security and Error Handling
Secure API Endpoints: The application secures all endpoints using token-based authentication to ensure only authenticated users can access resources.
Detailed Error Messages: Provides clear and informative error messages for validation failures, permission issues, and resource not found errors.
Input Validation: Implements input validation to prevent common issues such as missing required fields, invalid data formats, or unauthorized access.
11. Docker Support for Easy Setup and Deployment
Dockerized Environment: The backend service can be run in a Docker container, making it easier to set up and deploy.
Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications: Supports docker-compose for running the application along with its dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL) in a single command.
12. Unit Testing and Test Coverage
Automated Tests for Core Functionality: Tests cover key functionalities like project creation, permission handling, and user authentication.
Test Cases for Custom Permissions and Roles: Ensures that the RBAC model works as intended by testing various permission scenarios.
13. Flexible Role and Permission Configuration
Custom Roles and Permissions: The system can be extended to include more roles and custom permissions, allowing for flexible access control.
Organization-Based Permission Management: Permissions are tied to organizations, allowing the same user to have different roles in different organizations.
14. Real-Time Project Updates and Notifications (Optional)
Email Notifications for Membership Changes: Sends notifications to users when they are added to or removed from an organization.
Real-Time Status Updates (Using Websockets or Polling): Provides real-time feedback on project status changes or new comments, enhancing collaboration.
